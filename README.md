 Developed a simple Spring MVC mini application named "GreetApp" that generates personalized greetings based on the time of the day. 
 Utilized Spring's dependency injection mechanism (@Autowired) to inject a service component (GreetingImpl) into the controller (GreetController). 
 The service class dynamically generates greetings using Java's LocalDateTime class to determine the time of the day.
